## Description

By running tests against your app consistently, you can verify your app's correctness, functional behavior, and usability 
before you release it publicly.

Testing also provides you with the following advantages:

- **Rapid feedback** on failures.
- **Early failure detection** in the development cycle.
- **Safer code refactoring**, letting you optimize code without worrying about regressions.
- **Stable development velocity**, helping you minimize technical debt.

## Fundamentals-of-Testing

Users interact with your app on a variety of levels, from pressing a button to downloading information onto their device.
Accordingly, you should test a variety of use cases and interactions as you iteratively develop your app.

#### Organize your code for testing
As your app expands, you might find it necessary to fetch data from a server, interact with the device's sensors, access 
local storage, or render complex user interfaces. The versatility of your app demands a comprehensive testing strategy.
